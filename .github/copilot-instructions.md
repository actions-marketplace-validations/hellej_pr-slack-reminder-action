# Copilot Instructions for PR Slack Reminder Action

## Code Style

- Help the author to learn writing idiomatic Go code (the author is new to Go programming language)
- Encourage the use of Go modules and proper package structure
- Promote the use of clear and descriptive naming conventions for variables and functions
- Advocate for the use of idiomatic error handling patterns (e.g., returning errors instead of panicking)
- Encourage writing unit/integration tests for new features and maintaining high test coverage

## AI Code Generation

- Ask for more instructions and context if the prompt is unclear or lacks detail
- **No Explanatory Comments**: Do not add comments explaining what code does - use descriptive names instead
  - ❌ `slicesEqual := func(a, b []string) bool { ... } // Helper function to compare slices (order doesn't matter)`
  - ✅ `slicesEqualIgnoreOrder := func(a, b []string) bool { ... }`
  - Exception: Comments for complex algorithms or non-obvious business logic are acceptable
- Aim for simplicity and clarity in generated code

### Testing Strategy & Practices

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: ALWAYS use TDD approach when adding new features:
  1. Write failing tests first that describe the expected behavior
  2. Implement minimal code to make tests pass
  3. Refactor while keeping tests green
  4. Only skip TDD for very simple changes (like documentation updates)
- **Pragmatic Testing**: Balance thoroughness with practicality - focus on critical paths and user-facing behavior
- **Test Public Interfaces**: Focus tests on client/user-facing features and functionality rather than implementation details to avoid brittle tests that break during refactoring
- **Readable Tests**: Write tests that are easy to understand with minimal comments - use descriptive function and variable names instead of explanatory comments. The test structure and assertions should be self-explanatory
- **Reduce Boilerplate**: Create test helpers for setup and assertions when duplication emerges - check for existing helpers in `testhelpers/` package
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain high test coverage while avoiding testing internal implementation details that may change during refactoring
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Use table-driven tests for functions with multiple input scenarios to reduce duplication and improve readability
- **Main Tests**: `cmd/pr-slack-reminder/main_test.go` contains integration tests using full pipeline with mocks
- **Test Helpers**: `testhelpers/confighelpers.go` provides `TestConfig` struct and `SetTestEnvironment()` for consistent test setup
- **Mock Clients**: `testhelpers/mock*client/` provide injectable dependencies for testing

### Development Commands

See the Makefile for all available commands.

```bash
# Run with env vars (see Makefile `run` target for pattern)
make run

# Test with coverage
make test-with-coverage

# Build a specific target
make build-darwin-amd64

# Validate inputs consistency
go run .github/scripts/check_inputs.go
```

## Architecture Overview

This is a GitHub Action written in Go that fetches PRs from GitHub repositories and sends a Slack reminder listing them. The architecture follows a clear data pipeline:

1. **Config** (`internal/config/`) - Parses GitHub Action inputs using environment variables with `INPUT_` prefix pattern
2. **GitHub Client** (`internal/apiclients/githubclient/`) - Fetches PR data and reviews, applies filtering. Uses threefold participant collection (PR reviews, PR comments, PR timeline comments) to ensure comprehensive coverage of all PR discussion participants
3. **PR Parser** (`internal/prparser/`) - Enriches PR data with Slack user mappings and metadata
4. **Message Content** (`internal/messagecontent/`) - Structures data for messaging
5. **Message Builder** (`internal/messagebuilder/`) - Constructs Slack Block Kit messages
6. **Slack Client** (`internal/apiclients/slackclient/`) - Sends messages

## Key Patterns

### Input Configuration

- All GitHub Action inputs are accessed via `utilities.GetInput()` which converts `input-name` to `INPUT_INPUT_NAME` env vars
- Repository-specific mappings use semicolon/newline-separated format: `"repo1: value1; repo2: value2"`
- JSON inputs (filters, mappings) are parsed with `DisallowUnknownFields()` for strict validation

### Repository Processing

- Multiple repositories supported via `config.Repositories` slice of `Repository` structs (`config.InputGithubRepositories`)
- If `config.InputGithubRepositories` is set, `config.EnvGithubRepository` is ignored
- Repository filters are mapped by repository name (not full path)
- Each PR maintains its `Repository` field for context throughout the pipeline

### Error Handling

- Config validation uses `selectNonNilError()` to return first encountered error
- Filters validate mutual exclusivity (e.g., can't use both `authors` and `authors-ignore`)
- Missing required inputs fail fast with descriptive error messages

### PR Participant Collection

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: GitHub Client fetches participant data from three sources to ensure no discussion participant is missed:
  1. **PR Reviews** (`/pulls/{pull_number}/reviews`) - Formal review comments and approvals
  2. **PR Comments** (`/pulls/{pull_number}/comments`) - Line-specific code review comments  
  3. **PR Timeline Comments** (`/issues/{issue_number}/comments`) - General discussion comments on the PR timeline (PRs are also issues in GitHub's API)
- **Parallel Fetching**: All three data sources are fetched concurrently for optimal performance
- **Consistent Filtering**: All participant types undergo the same validation (bot exclusion, author exclusion from commenters, approvers take precedence over commenters)

### Slack Message Construction

- Uses Slack Block Kit with `RichTextBlock` and `RichTextSection` elements
- PR titles are clickable links
- Age indicators use emoji and bold styling for old PRs (`IsOldPR` field)

## File Relationships

- `action.yml` inputs must match constants in `internal/config/config.go`
- Test environment setup in `testhelpers/confighelpers.go` mirrors real config parsing
- The validation script `.github/scripts/check_inputs.go` ensures `action.yml` and config constants stay in sync

## Adding New Inputs (Features)

**Follow TDD approach:**

1. Add input to `action.yml`
2. Add constant to `internal/config/config.go`
3. **Write tests first** - create failing tests for the new functionality
4. Update `Config` struct and `GetConfig()` function to make tests pass
5. Implement feature logic in appropriate pipeline stage using TDD cycle
6. Ensure all tests pass and refactor if needed
